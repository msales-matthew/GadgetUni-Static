<p>Imagine yourself on a beautiful beach, or next to the lake, or just in your garden, by the pool. You lay down on a towel or a camping mat, but something is just not right. It’s comfortable and soft, but the sand is annoying, right? As well as the ground - can be a little bit to hard to lay on it for a longer time.

<p>How does it work? Take out the bag, unravel it, open it wide and swirl it around to fill it up with air. When full, close it up and fold the end. In the end, attach two buckles and seal it. Your inflatable couch is ready!</p>
