<p>No matter on which continent you live, there is always this moment in the year, when you just need to take couple of days off and go on holidays. Some of us love to travel alone, the others go with the family or friends. And those people who decide to share an adventure really often decide to pack some essential stuff to their car and go on a road trip, because it generates the best memories that you keep for many, many months or years.</p>

<p>And as we want to keep only the positive memories, we really need to minimize the risk of unpleasant things. We don’t want to remember that on the 2nd day we got a flat tire or a flat battery in the middle of nowhere and we had to wait several hours for help. Or that the kids or friends got bored so much that all the car started conversations, which switched to the regular quarrel and ruined the whole experience of being together and enjoying it.</p>

<p>So because of that, we prepared for you the list of TOP 5 gadgets to survive the road trip. And by the survival we mean both security, as well as keeping fellow travellers entertained and happy.</p>

<h2>PORTABLE BATTERY JUMP STARTER</h2>
<p>Did you ever got a flat battery in your car? This is usually very unexpected and one of the worst feelings ever. And of course forced to wait for help. What if you’re stuck in the middle of nowhere, where your phone signal doesn’t work? Of course, sounds not that likely to happen, but what if you’re in the Australian Outback or somewhere far from civilization in Canada? Portable battery jump starter might be the answer. This small sized device can save you no matter where you are. Just have it fully charged. It will save your time and nerves.</p>

<h2>WIRELESS CAR CHARGER</h2>
<p>Too many cables, especially while you’re driving, is not what you are willing to see. You need to focus on the road and it might be already difficult when your kids or friends are shouting from the backseat. You also want to know where your phone is and keep it in your sight, while almost all of us are using it as an GPS. The wireless car charger will keep your phone battery alive and as it is mounted to the air conditioner flow, you will be able to control what’s on the screen, without risking any dangerous situations on the road. And of course, no chaos with the multiple cables around.</p>

<h2>CAR TABLET MOUNT</h2>
<p>We all know - entertained passengers are the best passengers. As a driver, you want to keep them busy and happy, so you can focus on the road. Of course it is great to chat for some time, but when the topics finish… Give them some movies or favourite TV shows to watch. Or put on some cartoons for the kids. Car Tablet Mount will be useful to help with that.  When mounted to your headrest and adjusted with your iPad or other tablet , it will create a small cinema in the backseat of your car.</p>

<h2>BACK SEAT ORGANIZER</h2>
<p>So what about keeping the car clean during the journey? I can say from the experience - Mission: Impossible. Papers after candy bars or chips everywhere. I was able to find plastic bottles weeks after the road trip finished. And as it is your car - you get annoyed, even you’re prepared for the worst. A thing like back seat organizer can help to reduce the amount of mess. Cans or bottles in one place, as well as empty packages. And no need to stop when the “panic button” is pressed, because someone couldn’t find the phone, which was under the empty pack of crisps.</p>

<h2>BLUETOOTH AUDIO RECEIVER</h2>
<p>Road trip trail can lead us outside of civilization, where we can get no radio coverage. So that means there is no music. And we all love music - both drivers and passengers. Let’s keep it working as long as possible. Bluetooth Audio Receiver can help in that matter, so anyone in the car can connect their phone with the plugged device and start to stream their music. And the only thing you risk is your passengers arguing who is about to play their favourite song next.</p>
